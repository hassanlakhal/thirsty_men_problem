1. Game Setup and Group Formation
        A. Group Isolation
        Random Grouping: The participants are divided into smaller groups to create an isolated environment for each set of players. This ensures that players within a group cannot communicate with those outside their group.
        Fake Cups: Initially, each player is provided with a fake cup (empty or filled with non-drinkable substance), to create the illusion of having a real cup. This prevents players from cheating by preemptively claiming a cup and ensures that all cups in the game are equally empty until the final selection process.
        Neutral Facilitator: A neutral facilitator (the pourer) manages the game, ensures no communication occurs between groups, and oversees the randomness of cup placement and decisions.
2. Game Rules and Flow
        A. Cup Placement
        Anonymous Cup Assignment: Each player places their fake cup on the table. The cups are assigned numbers or identifiers that are not tied to any playerâ€™s identity.
        Randomization: The initial placement of cups is randomized. This ensures that players do not know which cup will be filled first or last, preventing any preemptive positioning or strategies.
        Fake Cups Create Fairness: Since players cannot directly identify which cups are fake, they are less likely to engage in collusion or attempt to manipulate the game in their favor.
        B. Coin Flip Rounds (Elimination Rounds)
        Guessing the Coin Flip: Each player participates in a round where they guess the outcome of a coin flip (heads or tails). This is a random event where no player can influence the outcome.
        Elimination: Players who guess incorrectly are eliminated from the game. If a player does not guess, the facilitator makes a random choice on their behalf.
        Final Two Players: The game progresses until only two players remain. These two players are declared the winners.
        C. Winner Selection
        Final Cup Assignment: The two remaining players are assigned the first and last cups in the lineup.
        Water Allocation: The pourer fills only these two cups with water, ensuring that only the first and last cups receive water. This maintains the fairness of the process, as the intermediate cups remain empty.



3. Game Setup

    Group Isolation: Imagine 10 participants are divided into two groups of 5. Each group is placed in a separate room, unable to communicate with the other.
    Fake Cups: Each player in both groups receives an identical empty cup.
    Game Flow

    Round 1:
        Cups are placed on a table in a random order (e.g., Cup 1, Cup 2, Cup 3, Cup 4, Cup 5).
        A coin is flipped.
        Players in each group guess "Heads" or "Tails."
        Let's say, in Group A, players 1, 3, and 5 guess incorrectly. They are eliminated.
        In Group B, players 2 and 4 guess incorrectly and are eliminated.
    Round 2:
        Remaining players in each group guess the coin flip again.
        Let's say, in Group A, player 2 guesses incorrectly and is eliminated.
        In Group B, player 1 guesses incorrectly and is eliminated.
    Round 3:
        In Group A, player 4 remains.
        In Group B, player 3 remains.
        Winner Selection:
        Player 4 from Group A and Player 3 from Group B are declared winners.
        The pourer fills only the first and last cups in each group with water.

Randomness: The coin flips are truly random, and the initial cup placement is also randomized to prevent any player from gaining an unfair advantage.
Fairness: The use of fake cups ensures that no player knows the location of the winning cups beforehand, preventing collusion or manipulation.
